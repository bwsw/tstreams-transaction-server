## Launching

There is two ways to launch TTS:
- via _java_ command
- via _docker_ image

You should pass a file with properties in both cases. The file should contain the following properties:

If server receives a client requests of size which is greater than maxMetadataPackageSize or maxDataPackageSize then it discards them and sends an exception to the client. If server during an operation undertands that it is near to overfill constraints it can stop the operation and return a partial dataset. |int    | 10000| [1,...]|
| max.data.package.size            | The size of data package that client can transmit or request to/from server, i.e. calling 'getTransactionData' method.

| incomplete.commit.log.read.policy| Policies to read from commitlog files. If 'resync-majority' mode is chosen then ???(not implemented yet). If 'skip-log' mode is chosen commit log files than haven't md5 file are not read. If 'try-read' mode is chosen commit log files than haven't md5 file are tried to be read. If 'error' mode is chosen commit log files than haven't md5 file throw throwable and stop server working. |string |error |[resync-majority (mandatory for replicated mode), skip-log, try-read, error] |
| commit.log.close.delay-ms        | the time through a commit log file is closed. |int  |200    |

| counter.path.file.id.gen         | the coordination path for counter for generating and retrieving commit log file id. | string | /server_counter/file_id_gen |

It isn't required to adhere the specified order of the properties, it's for example only. 
But all properties should be defined with the exact names and appropriate types. 

### Java

In addition to the properties file you should provide two dependencies through adding jars of 'slf4j-api-1.7.24' 
and 'slf4j-log4j12-1.7.24' to a classpath, to launch TTS. That is run the following command:

```bash
java -Dconfig=<path_to_config>/config.properties -cp <path_to_TTS_jar>/tstreams-transaction-server-<version>.jar:<path_to_slf4j_api_jar>/slf4j-api-1.7.24.jar:<path_to_slf4j_impl_jar>/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.24.jar com.bwsw.tstreamstransactionserver.ServerLauncher
```

### Docker

The docker file is in the root directory. To build image: 

```bash
docker build --tag bwsw/tstreams-transaction-server .
```

To download image use:
```bash
docker pull bwsw/tstreams-transaction-server
```

To run docker image you should provide a path to config directory where a file named 'config.properties' is, specify the external host and port to be able to connect:

```bash
docker run -v <path_to_conf>:/etc/conf/config.properties -v <path_to_databases_dir>:/storage -v <path_to_logs_dir>:/var/log/tts -p <external_port>:8080 -e HOST=<external_host> -e PORT0=<external_port> bwsw/tstreams-transaction-server
```
